# Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

## When an element is created inside a parent element's render method, a property is declared in the parent constructor which contains a reference to the element created in its render method

### When to Use Refs
There are a few good use cases for refs:

Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
Triggering imperative animations.
Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

### Don’t Overuse Refs
Your first inclination may be to use refs to “make things happen” in your app. If this is the case, take a moment and think more critically about where state should be owned in the component hierarchy. Often, it becomes clear that the proper place to “own” that state is at a higher level in the hierarchy. See the Lifting State Up guide for examples of this.
